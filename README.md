## Proof of Concept Overview
The proof of concept will consist of two main components: the WebRTC server and the client-side application.
### WebRTC Server
The WebRTC server will be written in Golang using the Pion WebRTC library, which is a pure Go implementation of the WebRTC API. The server will be responsible for establishing and managing WebRTC connections between clients and operators.
The server will use the RTCPeerConnection API to establish a connection between the client and server. It will also use the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to exchange media configuration information between the client and server.
## Client-Side Application
The client-side application will be written in a JavaScript framework of your choice. It will be responsible for connecting to the WebRTC server and initiating voice calls.
The client-side application will use the RTCPeerConnection API to establish a connection with the server. It will also use the getUserMedia API to access the user's microphone and initiate voice calls.
The client-side application will have a "Call Support" button that triggers the call. When the user clicks the button, the client-side application will initiate a WebRTC connection with the server and start the voice call.
Conclusion
This is a high-level overview of the proof of concept for the solution you requested. Please note that this is just an overview and the actual implementation may vary depending on your specific requirements and the JavaScript framework you choose to use.
